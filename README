original: ubuntu-sunrise then Earth-sunrise now ISS-sunrise
Another modification of the awesome plymouth theme made by Andre "Osku" Schmidt
This one uses actual images from the International Space Station to create the sundown and sunrise effect


Then extract the contents to your home or Desktop folder, then open a terminal and run this (firstly navigate to the folder where you extracted it using a terminal; if you extracted it on your Desktop, that would be: cd ~/Desktop):

sudo cp -R iss-sunrise/ /usr/share/plymouth/themes/
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/share/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth default.plymouth /usr/share/plymouth/themes/iss-sunrise/iss-sunrise.plymouth 100
sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth #here, choose the number of the theme you want to use then hit enter
sudo update-initramfs -u

Reboot and ready... should be running the new theme.

code notes
==========

the "offset" variable is used to set the y position of the planet top. 
0 would be center, positive values go down and negative to top of screen.
(all parts should use this offset)

if you scroll past the image/sprite definitions, you see some *.start and
*.end values. those say at which "progress-time" (from 0 to 1) that part
will be faded in. 

sunGlow also has .animStart/End "progress-time", to say when to move from
.startPos to .endPos on the screen
