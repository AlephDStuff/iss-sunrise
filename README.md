## Welcome to ISS-sunrise

iss-sunrise is a plymouth animated boot screen that should work on any system that uses plymouth to display an image as the system boots and before the login screen. It is based on Earth-sunrise, but here, the earth is depicted as having lights on the ground, and when the sun rises it has a KDE logo.
